STEP BY STEP APPROACH ON INTEGRATION OF GITHUB AND JIRA 

Here are the basic steps to link GitHub and Jira:

Log in to your Jira account and navigate to the "Applications" menu.

Select "DVCS accounts" from the list of applications.

Click on the "Link GitHub Account" button.

Follow the prompts to sign in to your GitHub account.

Select the repositories you want to link to Jira.

Set up the integration options, such as the Jira projects you want to link to your GitHub repositories.

Test the integration to ensure everything is working properly.

Once you've completed these steps, you should see a link between your GitHub repositories and your Jira projects. You can then use Jira to manage issues and track progress, while also using GitHub to manage your code changes. The integration should help streamline your workflows and improve collaboration across your team.
